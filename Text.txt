1. 
A lerp (aka. linear interpolation) is always the of the form
blendedValue=(1−t)⋅startValue+t⋅endValue

2.
Formula of a sphere in vector form:
(p−c)⋅(p−c)=R^2   where c is the center, P is a point
Therefore, to validate if a ray hits a sphere, use
t^2b⋅b +2tb⋅(a−c)+(a−c)⋅(a−c)−R^2=0

However, there are issues. Solutions should be >0, i.e. you can only see things in front of you.

3. 
Surface-normal 法向量
For a sphere, the outward normal is in the direction of the hit point minus the center.
